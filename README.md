# DB_CheckedTweets
The goal of this project is to provide a service for through which users can subscribe to tweets they can trust.
This service, dubbed CheckedTweets.org, allows users to attach evidence to some tweet (be it a scholarly article, an interview, etc..). Special users dubbed as “Checkers” will then determine whether or not the aforementioned evidence - when there is enough of it, that is - is sufficient to verify the tweet. If so, the tweet is then marked as “verified” (not to be confused with Twitter’s verified user concept) by that Checker. What’s great about CheckedTweets is
that the Checkers will have been carefully vetted by your company beforehand - they are among the experts in their fields. Checkers can come from a variety of backgrounds: political scientists, epidemiologists, climate scientists, etc... Once these tweets are verified by a Checker, they will then be visible to (and presumably pushed to) users who only want to read “checked tweets.”
